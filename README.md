The python version used for this is python2. libraries required for running the program has been placed in requirements.txt
You can install all required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
<br /> The repo consists of 5 files
1. a_star_algorithm.py - The file which contains the business logic - the 
 implementation of PID controller and A star planner.
2. datastructures.py - The file which contains datastructures used throughout
 the program
3. util_data_types.py - Some auxillary logics like custom data types, functions
for parsing data and plotting results for visualisation are placed within this
file
4. run_me.py - The master file which run all test cases.
5. test_cases.py - This is very specific to the assignment that was given. This
file just calls the core alogrithm to test a few cases that were asked in the 
assignment question.

<br />To run all test cases, just type `python run_me.py`. You can see all the 
test cases being run. 
<br />The code has been documented and that is self explanatory. For more details
about the implementation, please read the pdf report commited in the repo.
